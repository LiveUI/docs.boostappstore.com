# Vapor 3

Boost has been built on the top of a Vapor framework. We have picked Vapor as it was the most advanced Swift framework at the time. They also have an amazing support through their Slack channel where you very often able to talk to the developers themselves!

Coming with version 3, Vapor has become fully asynchronous and non-blocking which made it even faster and efficient processing requests.
